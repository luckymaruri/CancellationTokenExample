In C#, `CancellationToken` is used to signal that an operation should be canceled. It's often passed as a parameter to tasks or methods that support cancellation. This token is linked to a `CancellationTokenSource`, which can issue the cancellation request. When the token's `IsCancellationRequested` property is set to true, the operation can check this property or register a callback to respond to the cancellation, allowing for a graceful exit. This mechanism is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks run for an extended period or when resources need to be released promptly upon cancellation.
